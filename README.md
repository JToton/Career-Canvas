# Accessibility-Refactoring-Challenge

## Description

• Within this homework assignment/challenge I was tasked with focusing on enhancing accessibility and refactoring HTML and CSS code.
The assignment involved identifying and implementing improvements to make web content more inclusive and user-friendly for individuals with disabilities.
This task also included adding semantic elements to improve the code base in order to enhance its legibility.  The HTML and CSS assets should be easy to read, understand and if necesarry be worked on by another developer given this is commonplace within the industry.  
I also wanted to keep in mind a crucial peice of information from the challenge directions as well, "An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it."(Module 1 Challenge).
The presented tasks also included adding semantic HTML elements, and improving overall code structure and organization for better maintainability.
This assignment also provided an opportunity to learn about how creating a website that is accessible can impact a business. "Accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google"(Module 1 Challenge). 
This allows the website to recieve more traffic which can drastically assist in growing a business, generating income or attracted other potential partners.

   would meet standards within the industry (to the best of my knowledge).  Additionally, school resources, linked within the citations already, were used in combination to flush 
   out the design.
